BinaryTree_MaxParallelSearch
============================

Input data: tree, whose every element has randomly generated value (so called key); number of threads;
Problem: to write a parallel programm for searching max key.
Programm must create tree with required number of nodes, get number of threads from input stream , find a tree's node which contains max key and output information about this node.
